Testing

Given the state of project implementation unit testing was the only possible testing I could
complete.

Unit Tests

- Through project implementation all modules where tested as a new one was introduced 
- Functionality was varied as new modules where introduced.
- There where bugs when trying to close the socket and the IO operations, they where fixed.
- Error checking accounts for most abnormal user input as all of the input is read
    in via a String and checked if it needed to be use as an Integer.
- Multiple clients chat rooms can be opened at the same time and they are all able 
    to connect and chat if they are in the same chatroom, I had a total of 10 chats
    open at a time and they all worked as expected.
